  Iâ€™m a Germany-based data analyst with over seven years of experience in data-driven reporting. I take the same approach to data analysis that I took to journalism: Hunting down nuanced answers to complex questions and sharing my findings in compelling narratives that never lose sight of the big picture.
  <br><br>
  Whether the final product is a storyboard, an oral presentation or a quick email, I know how to mine data for actionable insights that earn attention and spark a-ha moments without sacrificing valuable context.
