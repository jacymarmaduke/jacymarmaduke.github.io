## About me


I’m a Germany-based data analyst with over seven years of experience in data-driven reporting. I take the same approach to data analysis that I took to journalism: Hunting down nuanced answers to complex questions and sharing my findings in compelling narratives that never lose sight of the big picture.


Whether the final product is a storyboard, an oral presentation or a quick email, I know how to mine data for actionable insights that earn attention and spark a-ha moments without sacrificing valuable context.


I’m looking for opportunities where I can take a creative and collaborative approach to data analysis that centers customer and client experience, whether in a full-time or part-time capacity. 

Fun facts about me: I'm a twin, I have an orange cat named Arthur who's converted more than one feline-hater, and I'm always up for karaoke.
