## About me


I’m a Germany-based data analyst with over seven years of experience in data-driven reporting. I take the same approach to data analysis that I took to journalism: Hunting down nuanced answers to complex questions and sharing my findings in compelling narratives that never lose sight of the big picture.


Whether the final product is a storyboard, an oral presentation or a quick email, I know how to mine data for actionable insights that earn attention and spark a-ha moments without sacrificing valuable context.


I’m looking for a position where I can take a creative and collaborative approach to data analysis that centers customer and client experience, whether in a full-time capacity or as a freelancer. If you're interested in working together, drop me a line at jacymarmaduke (at) gmail (dot) com.
