I used Python and Tableau to design a data-driven guide to apartment hunting in Germany for renters new to the country. The project was based on a dataset of over 250,000 web-scraped apartment listings and a dataset of population figures that I collected and transformed independently. The results were three-fold: Wrangling and analyzing the data revealed some of the most influential factors driving rent, mapping it showed what renters can expect for rents at a high and granular level, and through clustering I found distinct apartment "personality types" with unique profiles and rent expectations.
As an additional tool for renters, I created and mapped a new "hidden gem" statistic to help them find good deals on apartments in higher-demand locales.

Results: [Investigation published in USA Today](https://eu.usatoday.com/in-depth/news/nation/2021/11/22/us-forest-service-water-management-limited-oversight-diversions/8717970002/)

For this data journalism project, I used hard-won public records, expert interviews and extensive Excel data wrangling to create an interactive investigation of unmitigated water use on public lands amid a water crisis. The project's interactive data visualizations connect with both general and specialized viewers, offering opportunities to dive deeper through maps, charts and a virtual flight along a drought-stricken river. Mapping the water use and climate change data were especially important steps in conveying the scope of the problem. This project showcases my ability to find the story in complex datasets and show the viewer why the findings are important, a crucial skill for both journalism and data analysis.

### Planning Flu Season Hospital Support with Excel and Tableau

Results: [Tableau stoyboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/jacquelyn.marmaduke/viz/influenzastoryboard/Story1?publish=yes)

This Tableau and Excel-based project involved using United States population demographics and historic flu mortality to create state-level recommendations for hospital staffing support during flu season. I opted for a tiered recommendation scheme that accounted for recent mortality spikes in smaller states after it became clear that they might be overlooked because of lower total deaths and older residents. An interactive Tableau storyboard guides stakeholders through the recommendations, which also include suggested timing.

### Crafting Grocery Store Customer Profiles with Python

Results: [GitHub repository](https://github.com/jacymarmaduke/python_instacart)

I merged and analyzed several large Instacart datasets in Python to craft customer profiles based on shopper demographics and ordering habits. I found marked differences in shoppers' preferred day and time of day for ordering, so those became the basis of the profiles. The result was a set of business recommendations tailored to each group's shopping habits and most-frequented departments, all with the goal of encouraging larger and more frequent orders.

Results: [GitHub repository](https://github.com/jacymarmaduke/SQL_queries_movies) // [Stakeholder presentation](/pdf/sqlPres.pdf)

I mined a 15-table retail database for insights about a the company's inventory and customer base, which became the foundation for a set of business recommendations for an upcoming platform pivot.
