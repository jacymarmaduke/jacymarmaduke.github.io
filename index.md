### Analyzing German Apartment Data in Python

•	Designed a data-driven guide to apartment hunting in Germany, using correlation-testing, linear regression, geographic analysis and k-means clustering in Python to uncover useful insights for renters new to the country.

• Wrangled and cleaned a dataset containing over 250,000 web-scraped apartment listings, merging the data with an independently compiled population dataset to reveal the most influential factors driving rent and identify distinct apartment "personality types."

• Meticulously re-coded apartment data to create comprehensive, granular maps of average rent and other apartment characteristics throughout Germany.

• Illustrated analysis in Tableau storyboard with consumer-focused interactive maps and charts, including tools for personalized rent targets and finding “hidden gem” apartments.

### Tracking the Repercussions of Unmoderated Water Use on Public Lands

•	Hunted down public records and combined extensive data wrangling with insights from dozens of subject matter experts to produce this interactive investigation of unmitigated water use on public lands amid an American water crisis, weaving a narrative from the foundation of an unwieldy and opaque government dataset.
• Interactive data visualizations convey the significance and scope of the problem in a style that connects with both general and specialized viewers, with opportunities to dive deeper into the details through maps, charts and a virtual flight along a drought-stricken river.
• This project showcases the affinity for data that led me from journalism to data analysis. My natural curiosity and penchant for details served me well in journalism and shape the way I carry out data analysis.
